<CI HERE>
<COVERAGE HERE>
<TRACKING BOARD HERE>

TherapyTrack is an application for people with anxiety/depression that synthesizes user information in a single page report and remind users to schedule therapy appointments. This is the frontent element of the application.

#### Background

TherapyTrack has 2 main goals:

1. Provide appointment reminders for users so that they get to therapy
2. Generate a wellness report that will help them answer screening questions and more accurately reflect on their wellbeing over the last 2 weeks, 30 days, or 3 months

Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting 40 million adults in the United States, or 18.1% of the population every year. Anxiety disorders are often coupled with depressive disorders, such as major depressive disorder which affects about 6.7% of U.S. adults. However only 36.9% people affected by anxiety and 61.7% of those affected by depression receive treatment. The goal of this application is to allow users a way to synthesize information on their wellness and receive appointment reminders so that therapy appointments will be easier and less intimidating to attend.
